# Log_Analysis_for_DDoS_Attacks
Detects DDoS attacked IPaddresses from the Log Data

# Introduction to DDoS Attacks
* DDoS attack is a special sort of cyber-crime which tries to make a service or a server unavailable. In order to do so attackers infect one or various computers with malware. The attackers use this infected computer network, known as botnet, to launch their DDoS attack. Using the botnet, they attack their target by sending a large number of requests to the infrastructure. 
* DDoS attack is an incredible amount of traffic sent to your server that means an IP address makes x requests over y seconds.
* In this project we are trying to find out if a range of IP addresses sends too many connection requests over a small window of time.
